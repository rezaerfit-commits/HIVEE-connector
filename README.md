# Hivee Connector

Hivee Connector is a small edge bridge that runs next to a local OpenClaw runtime.

It exists so Hivee Cloud can talk to OpenClaw without forcing users to expose OpenClaw directly to the public internet.

The connector is responsible for:
- discovering a local OpenClaw runtime
- tracking locally available agents and models
- sending heartbeats to Hivee Cloud
- polling commands from Hivee Cloud
- executing those commands against local OpenClaw
- exposing a lightweight local admin UI for diagnostics

## Quick start

### First-time user (clone and run)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arieladhidevara/HIVEE-HUB.git
cd HIVEE-HUB
docker compose up -d --build
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:43137
```

On a VPS, open `http://<your-server-ip>:43137`.

After the UI opens:

1. Fill OpenClaw settings in the **OpenClaw** card (`Base URL`, `Token`, `Discovery candidates`, `Transport`).
2. Click **Save OpenClaw config**.
3. Click **Rediscover OpenClaw**.

### VPS access (Hostinger / cloud firewall)

If browser shows timeout when opening `http://<server-ip>:43137`, the service is usually running but blocked by network firewall.

Verify on VPS:

```bash
docker compose ps
curl -m 5 http://127.0.0.1:43137/health
sudo ss -lntp | grep 43137
```

If local health works, allow inbound TCP `43137` in your VPS provider firewall/security rules.

If you use UFW:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 43137/tcp
sudo ufw reload
sudo ufw status
```

### Reverse proxy option (Traefik on 80/443)

If your VPS only exposes `80/443`, put Hivee Connector behind Traefik.

Create `docker-compose.traefik.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  hivee-connector:
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.hivee.rule=Host(`hivee.your-domain.com`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.hivee.entrypoints=websecure"
      - "traefik.http.routers.hivee.tls=true"
      - "traefik.http.services.hivee.loadbalancer.server.port=43137"
    networks:
      - default
      - traefik_proxy

networks:
  traefik_proxy:
    external: true
    name: traefik_default
```

Run with:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.traefik.yml up -d --build
```

Notes:

- Replace `hivee.your-domain.com` with your domain.
- Your external Traefik network name may differ; check with `docker network ls`.

### Local

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:43137
```

Optional:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

You only need `.env` if you want to pre-seed defaults before opening the admin UI.

### Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:43137
```

On a VPS, open `http://<your-server-ip>:43137`.

OpenClaw connection details can be set later from the admin UI under the **OpenClaw** card.

## Important environment variables

These are the most important values to understand before debugging local OpenClaw connectivity:

- `OPENCLAW_BASE_URL`
- `OPENCLAW_DISCOVERY_CANDIDATES`
- `OPENCLAW_TOKEN`
- `OPENCLAW_TRANSPORT`
- `OPENCLAW_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS`

For many deployments, `OPENCLAW_TRANSPORT=http` is the most stable starting point.

## Common commands

The connector supports these command types:

- `connector.ping`
- `openclaw.discover`
- `openclaw.list_agents`
- `openclaw.chat`
- `openclaw.proxy_http`

## Troubleshooting

If local discovery fails, do not guess. Test the local OpenClaw HTTP surface directly.

Start with:

```json
{
  "method": "GET",
  "path": "/v1/models"
}
```

If you get HTML instead of JSON, your base URL is pointing at the wrong surface.

If you get `401 Unauthorized`, your token is wrong or missing.

If you get `connection refused`, your connector can resolve the hostname but nothing is listening on that port from the connector's point of view.

This repo is the connector only.

It is intentionally separate from Hivee Cloud itself.
